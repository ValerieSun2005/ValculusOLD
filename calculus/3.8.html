                        Optimization is the process by which a quantity of interest is maximized or minimized. 
                        It is a mathematical procedure that applies absolute extrema, covered in section
                        <a href="3.4.html">3.4</a>, to real-world problems.
                        The emphasis on efficiency in the everyday world cultivates the need for optimization in a wide range of applications, 
                        including geometry, finance, and science.
                        Examples of optimization problems include maximizing volume, 
                        minimizing surface area, minimizing materials used, minimizing time, and maximizing profit.  
                        In this section, we will discuss the strategy for solving these problems and explore their diverse uses.

                                To understand the problem, let's experiment with some possibilities: 
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        If \(a = 13\) and \(b = 1,\) then their product is \(13.\)
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        If \(a = 12\) and \(b = 2,\) then their product is \(24.\)
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        If \(a = 11\) and \(b = 3,\) then their product is \(33.\)
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        . . . 
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                The optimal combination of \(a\) and \(b\) maximizes the product \(P = ab\) 
                                while adhering to the condition that \(a + b = 14.\) 
                                Thus, we can write equations to model these qualities; 
                                this is the key step in optimization problems.
                                We have the requirement that \(a\) and \(b\) add up to \(14\!:\)

                                \begin{equation}
                                    a + b = 14
                                \end{equation}

                                We also know that
                                \begin{equation}
                                    P = ab
                                    \tag{2}
                                \end{equation}
                                From equation \((1),\) we can write \(b\) in terms of \(a, \)
                                \[a + b = 14 \implies b = 14 - a\,,\]
                                and plug it into equation \((2).\) 
                                Doing so produces
                                \[P = ab = a(14 - a)\,.\]
                                (We also could have expressed \(P\) in terms of \(b.\))
                                The objective of this algebraic manipulation is to express 
                                \(P\) in terms of a single variable, \(a.\) 
                                Thus, we can now write \(P\) as \(P(a).\) 
                                To maximize \(P(a),\) we find its critical points. 
                                Calculating the derivative, \(P'(a),\) and equating it to \(0\) give
                                \[
                                \ba 
                                P'(a) = 14 - 2a &= 0 \\
                                a &= 7\,.
                                \ea 
                                \]
                                We now need to justify whether \(a = 7\) corresponds to a relative maximum,
                                relative minimum, or neither. For \(a \lt 7,\) \(P' \gt 0;\) 
                                for \(a \gt 7,\) \(P' \lt 0.\)
                                Because \(P'(a)\) changes sign from positive to negative at \(a = 7,\) 
                                the First Derivative Test states that \(a = 7\) is the location of a relative maximum.
                                We know that this value corresponds to an absolute maximum if we consider extreme cases: 
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        For \(a \lt 0,\) it follows that \(b \gt 0\) and \(P \lt 0.\) 
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        For \(a \gt 14,\) it follows that \(b \lt 0\) and \(P \lt 0.\) 
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                Because \(P \to -\infty\) as \(a \to -\infty\) or \(a \to \infty,\) 
                                the relative maximum must be the absolute maximum.
                                <!--figure 1-->
                                <div class="fig-1 example-image">
                                    <img src="../images/Calculus/3/3.8/3.8-1.jpg" class="fig-1__image" alt="">
                                </div>
                                Moreover, we notice that \(P''(a) = -2\) \(\lt 0,\) 
                                indicating that \(P\) is concave down for all \(a.\) 
                                This analysis implies that \(a = 7\) must be an absolute maximum.
                                If we graph the function \(P(a) = a(14 - a),\) 
                                we notice that the point \((7, 49)\) is the vertex of the downward-opening parabola (see Figure 1).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Thus, for \(a = 7,\) \(b = 14 - 7 = 7\) and \(P = 49.\) 
                                We conclude that \(\boxed{a = 7 \; \textrm{and} \; b = 7}\) maximize the product \(P.\)

                        You must follow a procedure to find the absolute minimum or maximum of \(Q(x).\) 
                        The First Derivative Test and the Second Derivative Test allow you to determine
                        whether a critical number corresponds to a <i>relative</i> minimum or maximum. 
                        To locate the <i>absolute</i> minimum or maximum,
                        first establish the domain of \(Q.\) 
                        For example, if \(Q(x)\) represents area, then no side length \(x\) can 
                        result in a negative value of \(Q.\) 
                        Afterward, consider the endpoints or end behavior of the domain.
                        Analyze extreme cases: 
                        What happens to \(Q(x)\) if \(x\) is made as small as possible?
                        What happens if \(x\) is made as large as possible?
                        These steps form a coherent practice to justify that your answer is 
                        correct—that you successfully optimized \(Q.\)

                                With optimization problems, it is always useful to create a quick sketch, as shown by Figure 2.
                                For this problem, let \(w\) denote the width of the pen and let \(\ell\) denote the length. 
                                Also let \(A\) be the area of the pen. 
                                These suggestive variables facilitate understanding and avoid confusion.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Let's construct a system of equations. We know that  
                                \begin{equation}
                                    2w + \ell = 40 \, .
                                    \tag{1}
                                \end{equation}
                                We also have
                                \begin{equation}
                                    A = w \ell\,.
                                    \tag{2}
                                \end{equation}
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Rearranging equation \((1),\) we get \(\ell = 40 - 2w.\) 
                                We can substitute this expression into equation \((2)\) to acquire
                                \[ A = w \ell = w(40 - 2w)\,.\]
                                We now have a function of \(A\) composed solely of \(w\), 
                                so we can take its derivative to find its critical numbers: 
                                \[ \frac{\dd A}{\dd w} = 40 - 4w = 0 \implies w = 10\,.\]
                            </p>
                            <!--figure 3-->

                            </div>
                            <p>
                                We know that \(0 \leq w \leq 20 \), 
                                so we need to find the absolute maximum of \(A\) for all \(x\) in that interval. 
                                The absolute maximum either lies at the endpoints of the interval or at its critical points. 
                                By the First Derivative Test, \(w = 10\) corresponds to a relative maximum of \(A\) because 
                                the sign of \(\dd A/ \dd w\) changes from positive to negative at that point.
                                Conversely, at \(w = 0\) and \(w = 20,\) \(A = 0\) because the pen collapses into a straight line. 
                                 
                                Thus, \(w = 10\) must correspond to the absolute maximum of \(A.\)   
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For \(w = 10,\) we have \(\ell = 20.\)
                                Thus, a pen with dimensions \(20\) feet by \(10\) feet produces the maximum area, \(200\) square feet.

                        In the scope of a calculus class, the variety in optimization problems is limited;
                        instructors usually present the same types of problems. 
                        Therefore, you should familiarize yourself with the categories by practicing each one and understanding its solution process.

                            To visualize the scenario, 
                            our first step is to sketch a picture (see Figure 4).
                            To minimize the cost of manufacturing the can, we need to minimize the surface area. 
                            The surface area of a cylinder of radius \(r\) and height \(h\) is given by 
                            \begin{equation}
                                S = 2 \pi r^2 + 2 \pi r h\,.
                                \tag{1}
                            \end{equation}
                            (The bases of the cylinder are circles of area \(\pi r^2,\) 
                            and it is wrapped by a rectangular sheet of area \(2 \pi r h.\))
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We know that the expression for the volume of the cylinder is 
                            \begin{equation}
                                40 = \pi r^2 h\,.
                                \tag{2}
                            \end{equation}
                            Our goal is to express the surface area, \(S,\) in terms of solely one variable. 
                            This arrangement will enable us to find its minimum by differentiating and analyzing the critical numbers.
                            From equation \((2),\) we have
                            \[40 = \pi r^2 h \implies h = \frac{40}{\pi r^2}\,,\]
                            which we can plug into equation \((1)\) to get 
                            \[
                            \ba 
                            S &= 2 \pi r^2 + 2 \pi r \left(\frac{40}{\pi r^2}\right) \\
                            &= 2 \pi r^2 + \frac{80}{r}\,.
                            \ea 
                            \] 
                            Differentiating this expression and equating it to \(0\) yield 
                            \[
                            \ba 
                            S'(r) = 4 \pi r - \frac{80}{r^2} &= 0 \\
                            4 \pi r^3 &= 80 \\ 
                            r &= \sqrt[3]{\frac{20}{\pi}}\,. \\
                            \ea 
                            \]
                            
                            <!--figure 5-->

                            We now need to determine whether this critical number corresponds to a relative minimum, relative maximum, or neither.
                            For \(r \lt \sqrt[3]{20/\pi},\) \(S' \lt 0;\) for \(r \gt \sqrt[3]{20/\pi},\) \(S' \gt 0.\)
                            Because \(S'\) changes sign from negative to positive at the critical number \(r = \sqrt[3]{20/\pi},\) 
                            it corresponds to a relative minimum by the First Derivative Test. 
                            Additionally, since \(\lim_{r \to 0^+} S(r) = \infty\) and \(\lim_{r \to \infty} S(r) = \infty,\)
                            there needs to be a minimum value of \(S(r),\) which must exist at the critical number. (See Figure 5.)
                            This analysis confirms that \(r = \sqrt[3]{20/\pi}\) is the absolute minimum of \(S(r).\) 
                            We then have \(r \approx 1.853\) \(\textrm{in.}\) and
                            \[h = \frac{40}{\pi (20/\pi)^{2/3}} \approx 3.707 \; \textrm{in.}\]
                            Thus, a can with a radius of \(1.853\) \(\textrm{in.}\) and height \(3.707\) \(\textrm{in.}\) 
                            minimizes the cost of manufacturing while holding the required volume.
                            Notice that, with a radius of \(1.853\) \(\textrm{in.},\) the cylinder's diameter is \(3.707\) \(\textrm{in.},\)
                            the same dimension as the height. Symmetry promotes efficiency!

                        In some situations, minimizing or maximizing the square of a function is more convenient. 
                        If \(f(x)\) has a minimum or maximum at \(x = a,\) then so does \(\sqrt{f(x)}.\) 
                        This fact is useful in solving problems with square roots, such as in the context of distance.

                            <p>
                                Let's first draw a picture representing the situation, as shown by Figure 6,
                                and let \(d\) be this shortest distance. 
                                From the Distance Formula, 
                                \[d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\,,\]
                                we have \((x_1, y_1)\) \(= (0, 1)\) 
                                and \((x_2, y_2)\) \(= (x, x^2),\)
                                which is the point on the parabola.
                                Thus, we obtain
                                \[d = \sqrt{x^2 + (x^2 - 1)^2}\,.\]
                                Our goal now is to find the critical points of \(d.\) 
                                However, it is simplier to consider the square of the distance, \(d^2,\) 
                                as both functions have the same critical points. 
                                Let's reference \(d^2\) as the function 
                                \[q(x) = x^2 + (x^2 - 1)^2\,,\]
                                whose derivative is
                                \[q'(x) = 4x^3 - 2x\,.\]
                                Equating \(q'(x)\) to \(0\) gives
                                \[
                                \ba 
                                4x^3 - 2x &= 0 \\
                                2x(2x^2 - 1) &= 0 \implies \\
                                x &= 0 \\ 
                                x &= -1/\sqrt 2 \\ 
                                x &= \nspace 1/\sqrt 2 \,.
                                \ea 
                                \]
                                Notice that, had we differentiated \(d,\) we would have gotten
                                \[d'(x) = \frac{2x(2x^2-1)}{\sqrt{x^4 - x^2 + 1}}\,,\]
                                which has the same zeros as \(q'(x).\) 
                                These same solutions demonstrate that the critical numbers of \(d\) and \(d^2\) are the same, 
                                so considering \(d^2\) for convenience is justified. 
                            </p>

                                For \(x \lt 0,\) \(q' \lt 0;\) for \(x \gt 0,\) \(q' \gt 0.\)
                                Thus, \(x = 0\) corresponds to a relative maximum. 
                                We are interested in <i>minimizing</i> the distance, 
                                so we can ignore this critical number. 
                                Conversely, as you may verify, \(x = -1/\sqrt 2\) and \(x = 1/\sqrt 2\) both correspond to relative minima.
                                Because \(\lim_{x \to -\infty} d\) \(= \infty\) and \(\lim_{x \to \infty} d\) \(= \infty,\)  
                                the absolute minimum of \(d\) must lie at each of these relative minima (see Figure 7).
                                This result is intuitive because the graph of \(y = x^2\) is symmetrical with respect to \(x = 0,\) 
                                meaning that there are two points on the parabola for which \(d\) is minimized.

                                The word <i>inscribed</i> means the rectangle has two vertices on the parabola and two vertices on the \(x\)-axis,
                                as shown by Figure 8. Since the rectangle has length \(2x\) and height \(y,\) its area is 
                                \begin{equation}
                                    A = 2xy\,.
                                    \tag{1}
                                \end{equation}
                                But
                                \begin{equation}
                                    y = 9 - x^2\,.
                                    \tag{2}
                                \end{equation}
                                Substituting equation \((2)\) into equation \((1)\) enables us 
                                to express \(A\) solely in terms of \(x\!:\)
                                \[A = 2xy = 2x(9 - x^2)\,.\]
                                Finding the critical numbers of \(A(x),\) we get 
                                \[
                                \ba 
                                A'(x) = 18 - 6x^2 &= 0 \implies \\
                                x &= \nspace \sqrt 3 \\
                                x &= - \sqrt 3 \,, \\
                                \ea 
                                \]
                                both of which are relative maxima by the First Derivative Test. 
                                However, the domain of \(A(x)\) is \(0 \leq x \leq 3\)
                                because area cannot be negative, so we can discard the negative solution.
                                Additionally, the area is \(0\) at each endpoint because the rectangle collapses into a line.
                                Thus, \(x = \sqrt 3\) is the location of an absolute maximum of \(A.\)
                                For this value, \(y = 6.\) 
                                Therefore, a rectangle of length \(2 \sqrt 3\) and height \(6\textrm,\) 
                                with vertices at \(x = -\sqrt 3\) and \(x = \sqrt 3\textrm,\) 
                                is the largest possible rectangle that can be inscribed.

                        Let's now discuss the applications of optimization in business, especially as they relate to maximizing profit. 
                        A firm's profit function, \(P(x),\) is defined by 
                        \[
                        \ba 
                        \textrm{profit} &= \textrm{revenue} - \textrm{cost} \\
                        P(x) &= R(x) - C(x)\,,
                        \ea 
                        \]
                        where \(x\) is the number of units produced.
                        We will analyze cases in which a business's cost function is non-constant, since
                        in reality a firm needs to expand in order to produce a greater quantity of goods.
                        (You will see most cost functions with the property \(\lim_{x \to \infty} C(x) = \infty\) for this reason; 
                        expansion is expensive.) 
                        <i>Revenue</i> is the amount of money generated by the firm before cost is considered, and it is expressed by
                        \[\textrm{revenue} = \textrm{quantity} \cdot \textrm{price}\,.\]
                        A firm's <i>marginal cost</i> is the cost of producing one additional unit. 
                        Thus, it can be modeled by the derivative of the cost function, or \(C'(x).\) 
                        A firm's <i>average cost</i> is defined by the cost divided by the quantity produced:
                        \[\overline{C}(x) = \frac{C(x)}{x}\,.\]
                        At the quantity \(x\) at which the cost function is minimized, 
                        it follows that the average cost function is also minimized and that the marginal cost function equals \(0.\)

                                The profit function is given by (revenue) \(-\) (cost).
                                The revenue function is \(12x\) and the cost function is \(C(x),\) so we have 
                                \[
                                \ba 
                                P(x) &= 12x - (3000 - 100x + x^2) \\ 
                                &= -x^2 + 112x - 3000\,.
                                \ea 
                                \]
                                We now need to minimize \(P(x).\) 
                                Computing its derivative and finding its critical numbers give
                                \[
                                \ba 
                                P'(x) = -2x + 112 &= 0\\ 
                                x &= 56\,. \\
                                \ea 
                                \]
                                For \(x \lt 56,\) \(P' > 0;\) for \(x \gt 56,\) \(P' \lt 0.\) 
                                Thus, the critical number corresponds to an absolute minimum. 
                                We also know that the domain of \(P(x)\) is \(x \geq 0,\) 
                                so we need to consider its behavior at \(x = 0\) and as \(x \to \infty.\)
                                At \(x = 0,\) \(P = -3000;\) as \(x \to \infty,\) \(P \to -\infty.\) 
                                From this analysis, \(P\) has a maximum value, and it must be found at the critical number, \(x = 56.\) 
                                Therefore, Reverie should sell \(\boxed{56}\) hot dogs in order to maximize her profit. 
                                At this output level, her profit is 
                                \[P(56) = \boxed{136} \; \textrm{dollars} \, ,\] 
                                and her average cost is 
                                \[\overline{C}(56) = \frac{C(56)}{56} = \boxed{9.571} \; \textrm{dollars per hot dog} \, .\]

                                We need to write an expression for the revenue from eyeliner sales.
                                Let \(R(x)\) be the revenue function, where \(x\) is price in dollars. 
                                For every \(\$2\) increase, the price is \((10 + 2x)\) and the quantity of pencils sold is \((40 - 4x).\)
                                Revenue is the product of quantity and price, so we have
                                \[
                                \ba 
                                \textrm{revenue} &= \textrm{quantity} \cdot \textrm{price} \\ 
                                R(x) &= (40 - 4x)(10 + 2x) \\
                                &= -8x^2 + 40x + 400\,.
                                \ea 
                                \]
                                Its critical numbers are
                                \[
                                \ba 
                                R'(x) = -16x + 40 &= 0 \\
                                x &= \frac{40}{16} = 2.5\,.
                                \ea 
                                \]
                                For \(x \lt 2.5,\) \(R' \gt 0;\) for \(x \gt 2.5,\) \(R' \lt 0.\) 
                                Thus, the First Derivative Test states that \(x = 2.5\) corresponds to a relative maximum of \(R(x).\)
                                Additionally, the domain of \(R(x)\) is \(x \geq 0,\) so we need to consider \(R(0)\) and its behavior as \(x \to \infty \!:\)
                                <ul>
                                    <li>

                                    <li>
                                        \(R(2.5) = 450.\)
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        \(\ds \lim_{x \to \infty} R(x) = -\infty.\)

                                </ul>
                                From these candidates, \(x = 2.5\) corresponds to the absolute maximum of \(R(x).\) 
                                Therefore, the store should raise the price of the eyeliner pencil by \(\boxed{\$2.5 \,.}\)

                        The following examples are complex problems that require calculators, so we will only concern ourselves with the setup.
                        You should graph the function on a calculator to verify that a solution corresponds to an absolute extremum.
                        Additionally, some of the exercises for this section do not contain in-depth explanations for why a quantity is an absolute extremum;
                        you should be able to provide a justification yourself or graph the function.

                            A lifeguard on the shoreline rushes to assist a drowning swimmer
                            located \(20\) feet east from the lifeguard and \(8\) feet from the shoreline.
                            The lifeguard can run at \(10\) feet per second and swim at \(6\) feet per second.
                            She runs a distance \(x\) before jumping into the water and swimming to the drowning person, 
                            as shown by Figure 9. 
                            At what distance \(x\) should the lifeguard enter the water in order to minimize the time to rescue the swimmer?
                            (Note: Figure not drawn to scale; calculator required.)

                                We need to derive an expression for the time, \(t,\) the lifeguard takes to rescue the swimming person.
                                The distance she runs is \(x,\) and the distance she swims is \(\sqrt{(20 - x)^2 + 64}.\)
                                The relationship between time, distance, and speed is
                                \[\textrm{time} = \frac{\textrm{distance}}{\textrm{speed}}\,.\]
                                The lifeguard's speed is \(10\) feet per second onshore and \(6\) feet per second in water. 
                                Therefore, her time for the first part of the trip, running onshore, is   
                                \[t_1 = \frac{x}{10}\,.\]
                                Her time for the second part of the trip, swimming, is 
                                \[t_2 = \frac{\sqrt{(20 - x)^2 + 64}}{6}\,.\]
                                The total time, \(t,\) is the sum of these times:
                                \[
                                \ba 
                                t &= t_1 + t_2 \\
                                &= \frac{x}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{(20 - x)^2 + 64}}{6}\,.

                                This expression is in terms of \(x,\) so we can differentiate to locate its critical numbers:
                                \[
                                \ba

                                x &= 14\,.
                                \ea

                                \(x = 14\) is the location of a relative minimum of \(t\) 
                                since \(\dd t/ \dd x\) changes sign from negative to positive there. 
                                This value is also location of the absolute minimum, as shown by the graph of \(y = t(x)\) in Figure 10.
                                At \(x = 14,\) \(t = 3.067 \!:\) 
                                The lifeguard should run \(14\) feet onshore before jumping into the water and swimming to the drowning person.
                                This path allows her rescue the swimmer as quickly as

                                Differentiating and setting the resulting expression equal to \(0\) produce

                            Two power towers—one of height \(10\) meters and the other of height \(15\) meters—are located \(30\) meters apart. 
                            Wire is anchored from the ground to the top of each tower, as shown by Figure 12. 
                            Where should the wires be anchored so that the least amount of wire is used?

                                To obtain the expression for the total amount of wire required, 
                                we need to find the amount of wire needed from the anchor to the top of each tower.
                                For the \(15 \; \textrm{m}\) tower, let \(x\) be the distance from the base of the power to the anchor point. 
                                It then follows that the amount of wire needed is 
                                \[w_1 = \sqrt{x^2 + 15^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + 225}\,.\]
                                For the \(10 \; \textrm{m}\) tower, the distance from the anchor point to its base is \(30 - x.\)
                                The amount of wire needed is then 
                                \[w_2 = \sqrt{(30 - x)^2 + 10^2} = \sqrt{x^2 - 60x + 1000}\,.\] 
                                Therefore, the total amount of wire required is 
                                \[
                                \ba 
                                w &= w_1 + w_2 \\ 
                                &= \sqrt{x^2 + 225} + \sqrt{x^2 - 60x + 1000}\,. 
                                \ea 
                                \]
                                Finding its derivative and equating it to \(0\) give 
                                \[
                                \ba 
                                \frac{\dd w}{\dd x} = \frac{x - 30}{\sqrt{x^2 - 60x + 1000}} + \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 225}} &= 0 \implies \\
                                x &= 18\,.
                                \ea 
                                \]
                                This critical number corresponds to the absolute minimum of \(w.\)
                                Thus, the optimal spot to anchor the wires is \(18 \; \textrm{m}\) right of the \(15 \; \textrm{m}\) tower.
