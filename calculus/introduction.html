                        <p>Isaac Newton, pictured above, is well known for his development of calculus and contributions to physics during the scientific revolution. (Painting by Godfrey Kneller, Public Domain, via Wikimedia Commons) </p>

                    <p> Welcome to calculus! You're studying the mathematics that changed the world forever. Calculus is a modern discipline that was taught in graduate school not too long ago! 
                        Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz are credited for pioneering the ideas of calculus in the late 1600s, although methods of calculus were first developed in the late 500 BC. 
                        Calculus is the study of change, with one of its prominent themes being the concept of infinity, a theory to model arbitrarily large or extreme numbers.
                        Calculus classes introduce three main tools — limits, derivatives, and integrals. 
                    </p>
                    <div class="image-side">
                        <img class="image-side-image" src="../images/Calculus/0/0.1/0.1-2.jpg" alt="">
                        <p> The exact area under the curve \(x^2\) from \(x = 0\) to \(x = 3\) turns out to be \(9\)! You'll see how to obtain this value by adding up infinitely small rectangles. </p>
                    </div>
                    <p> Throughout the course, you'll appreciate the completeness and connectedness of every topic. You'll see problems asking you to find the slope of tangent lines, the area under curves, and the value to which a function converges. 
                        In non-calculus-based science courses, you'll hear indirect mentions of calculus — such as probability density curves, instantaneous speed, and growth rate. 
                        Many formulas you see in chemistry, physics, and elementary algebra are solutions to differential equations derived from calculus; and throughout my calculus page you'll see dedicated pages to applications.
                    </p>

                        <p>Tangent lines are useful tools for approximating the value of a function. In this case the tangent line to \(y = \sqrt{x}\) is shown. You'll learn to find the slope of this line and use it to construct linear approximations for \(\sqrt{x}\). </p>
                    </div>
                    <p> You'll learn how to evaluate indeterminate forms such as \(0^{0}\), \(\frac{\infty}{\infty}\), \(\frac{0}{0}\), \(0^{\infty}\), and \(\infty^{0}\). 
                        You'll see how the theory of infinity turns approximations into precise answers. You'll also learn how tools involving infinity allowed us to derive the volume of geometric objects such as spheres, cones, and ellipsoids. 
                    </p>
                    <p> If you're taking calculus in college, you're probably taking either Calculus I, II, or III. Calculus I covers limits and differentiation, with an introduction to integration. 
                        Calculus II builds on Calculus I by covering integration; emphasizing its applications to parametric, polar, and vector-based functions; and introducing series. Calculus III applies all of Calculus I and II to 3D planes, with tools such as vectors and multivariable functions.
                        If, however, you're in high school, then hello there, smartypants :) You're likely taking AP Calculus — either AB or BC. AB is equivalent to Calculus I, and BC is equivalent to Calculus I and II but with some rough differences in material and depth.
                        If you do well on the AP exam (typically a 3 or higher), you may receive college credit. 
                    </p>
                    <p> I have broken down the sections on this page into 10 chapters based on where I, personally, see fit. 
                        Some of the content on this site may not be covered by your instructor, so I recommend that you refer to your syllabus for the sections you can skip.  
                        If you are in AP Calculus AB, you'll be using Chapters 1 – 7. If you are in AP Calculus BC, you'll be using Chapters 1 – 10. 
                        Please consult the 
                        <a href="https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-calculus-ab-bc-course-a-glance-0.pdf?course=ap-calculus-bc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" style="color:plum">Collegeboard syllabi</a> 
                        for Calculus AB and BC to determine which sections to skip over.
                         And if you're in Calc 3, stay tuned for when I add material for that course!
