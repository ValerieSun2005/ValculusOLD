                    <p> <b>(27)</b> An object falls at an initial speed \(v_0\) and final speed \(v_f\) (the speed right before it hits the ground) after the time \(t\) has elapsed. It is known that the acceleration due to gravity is the constant \(g = 9.8 m/s^2\). Neglecting air resistance, derive an expression for \(v_f\) in terms of \(v_0\), \(t\), and \(g\). (Hint: Use the fact that \(a = \frac{dv}{dt}\), where \(v\) denotes velocity, \(a\) denotes acceleration, and \(t\) denotes time.) </p>

                    <p> <b>(28)</b> Newton's Second Law states that \(F = ma\), where \(F\) denotes the net force applied on the object, \(m\) denotes the object's mass, and \(a\) denotes its acceleration as a function of time. An object, originally at rest, is located \(2\) meters from its starting point after time \(t = 5\) seconds. Assume that the net force stays constant. Derive an expression for the position function of the object in terms of \(F\), \(m\), \(a\), \(t\), and physical constants, as appropriate. </p>
