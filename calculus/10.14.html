                        In this section we will discuss the Lagrange Error Bound, a formula used to find an error bound for a Taylor Series. 
                        The Lagrange Error Bound (also known as Taylor's Remainder Theorem) is similar to the Alternating Series Error Bound (9.15) 
                        but with an element of "human" to it. The formula for the Lagrange Error Bound is given by
                    </p>
                    <div class="highlight">
                        $$ E_n(x) \leq \Big|\frac{M(x-c)^{n+1}}{(n+1)!}\Big|, $$ (Lagrange Error Bound)
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        where \(n\) denotes the degree of the Taylor approximation, \(c \,\) denotes the point at which the Taylor Series is centered, 
                        and \(M\) is a constant such that \(M \geq f^{(n+1)}(z)\) for all \(z \in [x,c]\). 
                        Notice that the formula resembles the next term in a Taylor approximation, 
                        from which we construct an error bound—similar to what we did with the Alternating Series Error Bound.

                                from which we can approximate \(f(1.2)\) by plugging in \(x = 1.2\): 
                                $$ f(1.2) \approx 4 -2(1.2-1) + 8(1.2-1)^2 + \frac{1}{2}(1.2-1)^3 -\frac{1}{24}(1.2-1)^4 $$

                                In this case we know that \(n = 4\), \(x = 1.2\), and \(c = 1\). 
                                Additionally, we know that \(f^{(5)} \leq 50 \) for all \(x \in [1,1.2]\), so we can let \(M = 50\) to utilize it as an upper bound. 
                                Plugging in everything gives $$ \text{error} \leq \Big| \frac{50(1.2-1)^{4+1}}{(4+1)!} \Big| $$

                                The error of the approximation is given by the Lagrange Error Bound. 
                                In this case \(n = 3\), \(x = 0.9\), and \(c = 0.9\). 
                                We need the maximum value of the \((n+1)\)st derivative on the interval between \(0\) and \(0.9\). 
                                In this case we're looking for the \(4\)th derivative of \(e^x\), which is of course simply \(e^x\). 
                                The maximum of \(e^x\) on \([0,0.9]\) is \(e^{0.9}\), but that's the value we're trying to approximate! 
                                It makes zero sense to simply plug it in for \(M\), 
                                so we should set \(M\) to a number clearly greater than \(e^{0.9}\) of which we know the numerical value. 
                                In this case \(3 > e^{0.9}\), so let \(M = 3\). 
                                $$ \text{error} \leq \Big| \frac{M(x-c)^{n+1}}{(n+1)!}\Big| = \Big| \frac{3(0.9)^4}{4!} \Big|. $$

                                so the interval in which the actual value of \(e^{0.9}\) must lie is 
                                $$ [2.4265 - 0.082, 2.4265 + 0.082] = [2.344, 2.509]. $$

                                The error of the approximation is given by the Lagrange Error Bound. 
                                In this case \(n = 5\), \(x = 0.9\), and \(c = 0\). 
                                We then need to find the maximum value of the sixth derivative of \(\sin(x)\), \(-\sin(x)\), between \(0\) and \(0.9\). 
                                The maximum value in magnitude of \(-\sin(x)\) between \(0\) and \(0.9\) is \(-\sin(0.9)\); 
                                we consider the absolute value because the formula for error is always positive.  
                                Again, it makes no sense to let \(M = -\sin(0.9)\) because it defeats the purpose of performing series approximations. 
                                The mindset we should have is that in which we have no calculator (or have a non-scientific one) and are doing these computations by hand. 
                                We know that sinusoidal functions — \(\sin()\) and \(\cos()\) — are bounded between \(-1\) and \(1\). Thus, \(1 \geq \sin(0.9)\), so let \(M = 1\). 
                                We then have that $$ \text{error} \leq \Big| \frac{M(x-c)^{n+1}}{(n+1)!}\Big| = \frac{0.9^6}{6!} $$ $$ = 0.0007. $$
