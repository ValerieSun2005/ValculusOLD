                    <p><b> (12) </b> Money in a savings account grows at a rate proportional to the amount of money in the account at a given time \(t\). There are originally \(1500\) dollars in the account, and after a year there are \(1550\) dollars. How much money will be in the account after three years? </p>
                    <p><b> (13) </b> People at a train station enter at a rate given by \(E(t) = t^2 - 2t + 6\) and leave at a rate given by \(L(t) = 15\sin{(t}) + 20\). There are originally \(500\) people in the train station. Find the expression for the number of people in the train terminal in terms of \(t\).</p>
                    <p><b> (14) </b> Pigs enter a pen at a rate given by \(g(t) = \frac{50}{t+3}\) and exit at a rate given by \(h(t) = 2\sin{(2t)-3}\). At \(t = 0\) there are \(30\) pigs inside the pen. Model a function for the number of pigs in the pen at a given time \(t\). </p>
                    <p><b> (15) </b> Newton's Law of Cooling states that \(\frac{dT}{dt} = -k(T-T_s)\), where \(T\) denotes the temperature of an object as a function of time \(t\), \(T_s\) denotes the temperature of the outside environment, and \(k\) is the heat transfer coefficient. Derive an expression for \(T\) as a function of \(t\).  </p>
                    <p><b> (16) </b> An object with mass \(m\) is pulled with a constant force \(F_a\) and experiences a drag force modeled by \(\beta v^2\), where \(\beta\) is a constant and \(v\) denotes the object's velocity. Derive an expression for the velocity of the object in terms of \(t\), \(F_a\), \(m\), and \(\beta\), as appropriate. (Hint: Apply Newton's Second Law to obtain \(F_a - \beta v^2 = mv \, ' \).) </p>
                    <p><b> (17) </b> A falling object experiences air resistance modeled by \(kv\), where \(k\) is the drag coefficient of the object and \(v\) denotes the object's velocity. By Newton's Second Law, \(kv - 10m = m\frac{dv}{dt}\), where \(m\) denotes the mass of the object and \(t\) denotes time. Derive an expression for \(\lim_{t \to \infty} v(t)\) in terms of \(m\) and \(k\). (This is called the terminal velocity of the object, the maximum speed at which the object can fall on Earth.)  </p>
                    <p><b> (18) </b> A probability density function (PDF) is a function whose curve produces an area that gives the probability that a continuous random variable will fall within a range of values. This function of area is called a cumulative density function (CDF), defined as the integral of the PDF. Common examples of CDFs include Normal, \(t\)-, and \(\chi^2\)-distributions, which are fundamental tools for statistical inference. The fundamental property of probability density functions is that the area under them is always \(1\). Let \(p(x)\) denote a probability density function given by \(ke^{-kx}\) for \(x \geq 0\), where \(k\) is a constant. Find the CDF for \(p(x)\), which outputs the probability that a random variable will take a value less than or equal to \(x\). </p>
